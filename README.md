## 📊 How to Use

### 1. Choose Variable Type
Select either **Discrete (DRV)** or **Continuous (CRV)**.

### 2. Define Range or Bounds
- **Discrete**: Enter comma-separated values (e.g., `1,2,3,4,5` or `0,1,2,3,...` for infinite series)
- **Continuous**: Enter lower and upper bounds (e.g., `0, 1` or `-inf, inf`)

### 3. Enter Probability Function
Write your probability function using available mathematical functions:
- `factorial(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, `exp(x)`, `log(x)`
- `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`
- Constants: `pi`, `e`

### 4. Select Moment Reference Point
Choose to calculate moments about:
- The origin (a = 0)
- The mean (a = μ)
- A custom value

### 5. Set Parameters
- Maximum moment order 
- Calculation and display precision

### 6. Click "Compute!"
View your results with convergence analysis and statistical measures.

## 🧮 Examples

### Discrete Examples

**Finite Uniform Distribution:**
```
Range: 1,2,3,4,5
PMF: 0.2 if 1 <= x <= 5 else 0
```

**Geometric Distribution:**
```
Range: 0,1,2,3,...
PMF: 0.3 * (0.7 ** x) if x >= 0 else 0
```

**Poisson Distribution:**
```
Range: 0,1,2,3,...
PMF: (exp(-3) * 3**x) / factorial(x) if x >= 0 else 0
```

### Continuous Examples

**Uniform Distribution:**
```
Range: [0, 1]
PDF: 1 if 0 <= x <= 1 else 0
```

**Exponential Distribution:**
```
Range: [0, inf]
PDF: 2*exp(-2*x) if x >= 0 else 0
```

**Normal Distribution:**
```
Range: [-inf, inf]
PDF: exp(-(x**2)/2) / sqrt(2*pi)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Q: I get "module 'numpy' has no attribute 'math'"**  
✅ **Fixed in deployed version.** Uses `math.factorial` instead of `np.math.factorial`.

**Q: The landing page doesn't render properly**  
✅ **Fixed.** Uses Streamlit-native rendering for maximum compatibility.

**Q: My probability function isn't working**  
✅ Check that:
- You're using allowed functions (factorial, sqrt, exp, etc.)
- Your syntax is correct (Python syntax)
- Probabilities sum to 1.0 (discrete) or PDF integrates to 1.0 (continuous)

**Q: Infinite series aren't converging**  
✅ The app provides convergence analysis. Try:
- Increasing the maximum terms (up to 500)
- Checking your function for mathematical errors
- Using the debug information provided
